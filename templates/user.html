Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions,
dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms
beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines
remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to
various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for
applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants 
including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
